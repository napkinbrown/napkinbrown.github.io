A few weeks ago I participated in the [2022 Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org) asynchronously over Discord. For those unfamiliar, GGJ is an event where developers, designers, and artists at locations all over work together in teams to create a game in a 48 hour period. Each game has to follow a common theme, this year's being **"Duality"**. GGJ events took place from January 20th-30th, with them announcing the theme on the first day. I participated The Seattle area jam, run by the [Seattle Indies](https://www.seattleindies.org/) from January 28th to January 30th.

I could describe to you what the game is, *or you just go play it* üëÄ

I learned a ton from the experience. I've been busy with other projects lately, so I've been slow to write, but I'll be posting a retrospective of the lessons I learned. Look out for that in the next week or so ‚úåÔ∏è
