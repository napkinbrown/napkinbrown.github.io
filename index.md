**Hey there!** My name is Dominic Brown. I am a Computer Science student at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/), Track in Cybersecurity (graduating December 2021). Currently I work as a Full Stack Software Engineer at [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/). I also serve as the President for [HackPack](https://hackpack.club/), the cybersecurity club at NCSU. 

Here you'll find some of my independant projects, as well as writeups from CTFs I've competed in recently. 

If you want to get in contact with me, you can find links to my socials below.
