**Hey there!** I'm Dom, and I'm a software engineer living in the Seattle area. I'm originally from North Carolina and graduated from [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) in December 2021 with a Bachelors in Computer Science, Track in Security. While there, I served as the President for [HackPack](https://hackpack.club/), the cybersecurity club. Currently I work as a Full-Stack Software Engineer at [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/), maintaining a web-based authoring platform using Spring and ReactJs. 

I write about my independent projects, which include game development, cybersecurity, and any other technology-agecent pursuits. My goal isn't only to document my work, but to share and reflect on what Iâ€™ve learned while researching and creating. I also want to be honest and open about the experiences I have, and share the artist side of programming and technology. Lastly, communication is a good skill to practice in any profession, but it's especially important in writing code that others (or future you!) will be able to understand.

I would love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out at any of my socials below.
